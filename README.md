# NodeCopter Contest for Lunch and Learn (aka Fun Friday)

- Quick 5 minute demostration of how to create nodecopter flight commands in javascript.
- 1 hour to build and submit your flight code file, it should be your name.js
- Once all entries are submitted, we will go in the back and execute each entry and stream for remote viewers.  This should take about 30 minutes, feel free to watch the flights remotely using https://stre.am

Just subscribe to https://stre.am/twilson63 and you will get notified when the bots are flying.

Then everyone will have the afternoon to vote on the most awesome and successful flight.
